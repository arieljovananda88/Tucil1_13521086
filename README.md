# IF2211 Algorithm Strategies Course
## 24 Game Solver Using Brute Force Algorithm
This project is a program that solves the mathematical challenge known as the "24 Game," which involves manipulating four integers that stand in for card numbers in such a way that the final result is 24. In order to discover a solution for each permutation, the program employs a brute-force method that involves taking four integers as inputs or generating 4 random integers, creating all conceivable combinations of those integers, and evaluating combinations of all potential sets of mathematical operations. The program has additional features that allow you to output solutions in a human-readable format and has the option to save the results to a text file.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (such as G++ or Clang)
- The C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

### Installing
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AlifioDitya/Tucil1_13521142.git
```
2. Change directory to `bin` folder
``` bash
$ cd bin
```
3. Run executable file
``` bash
$ ./main.exe or ./main
```
### Usage
The user will be given two choices, one is to prompt four integers or let the program generate its own random four integers when the software is executed. Once all conceivable combinations of these integers have been generated, the computer will employ a series of mathematical operations to determine a solution for each combination. In addition to providing the ability to save the solutions to a text file, the application will output all solutions and execution time in a human-readable format.
